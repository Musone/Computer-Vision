It will print two figures inline: one containing the original image and the other showing the region to be filled and the texture region. You will be asked, \"Are you happy with this choice of fillRegion and textureIm?\". You should type \"Yes\" to proceeed. Finally, the script will print a figure of the image with the texture filled in. As this skeleton program is missing some critical routines, the texture will initially be filled in as all black."
